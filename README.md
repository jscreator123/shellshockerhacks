## Esp
A hack that allows you to see through walls. Pretty simple. Blue hitboxes represent people. The lines going from you to them are so that you will know if someone is sneaking up behind you, in which case a blue line would point behind you. If you find these lines annoying, press [N] to turn them off.

## Aimbot
Not like normal aimbot, this just locks your aim onto the nearest player. 

You may still miss. This does not automatically shoot for you.

May lock through walls. Recommended guns to use with aimbot:

Ranking:
1. EPIC
2. Goat
3. Ok

- EggK-47 (Goat)
- Scrambler (EPIC)
- Crackshot (EPIC)
- Free Ranger (Ok)

[b] to turn this off. You will need to do this multiple times on most maps, because climbing stairs or ladders is very hard with it on.

## Close tab
If you are hiding this from your parents or your teacher or your friends or somebody, press c to instantly close the tab.
